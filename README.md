## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Recently, I started a React for Beginners course on Scrimba and as a way to practice what I learned, I chose to do this project

I learned a bit on how to use CSS Grid and Flex while working on React. I also put my array map method to use while getting the data from the json file
```js
data.map((item) => ())
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning React while working on CSS Frameworks

### Useful resources

- [MDN Array Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) - I used this as a point of reference for my code
